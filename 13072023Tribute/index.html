      <h2>About Rabindranath Tagore</h2>
      <p>
        Rabindranath Tagore was a Bengali poet, writer, playwright, composer,
        philosopher, social reformer and painter. He reshaped Bengali literature
        and music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late
        19th and early 20th centuries.He was a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which
        was a new religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal and which
        attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid
        down in the Upanishads.

      <h2>Notable Works</h2>
      <p>
        Although Tagore wrote successfully in all literary genres, he was first
        of all a poet. Among his fifty and odd volumes of poetry are Manasi
        (1890) [The Ideal One], Sonar Tari (1894) [The Golden Boat], Gitanjali
        (1910) [Song Offerings], Gitimalya (1914) [Wreath of Songs], and Balaka
        (1916) [The Flight of Cranes]. The English renderings of his poetry,
        which include The Gardener (1913), Fruit-Gathering (1916), and The
        Fugitive (1921), do not generally correspond to particular volumes in
        the original Bengali; and in spite of its title, Gitanjali: Song
        Offerings (1912), the most acclaimed of them, contains poems from other
        works besides its namesake. Tagoreâ€™s major plays are Raja (1910) [The
        King of the Dark Chamber], Dakghar (1912) [The Post Office], Achalayatan
        (1912) [The Immovable], Muktadhara (1922) [The Waterfall], and
        Raktakaravi (1926) [Red Oleanders]. He is the author of several volumes
        of short stories and a number of novels, among them Gora (1910),
        Ghare-Baire (1916) [The Home and the World], and Yogayog (1929)
        [Crosscurrents]. Besides these, he wrote musical dramas, dance dramas,
        essays of all types, travel diaries, and two autobiographies, one in his
        middle years and the other shortly before his death in 1941. Tagore also
        left numerous drawings and paintings, and songs for which he wrote the
        music himself.

      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>
        Rabindranath Tagore's writing is deeply rooted in both Indian and
        Western learning traditions. Apart from fiction in the form of poetry,
        songs, stories, and dramas, it also includes portrayals of common
        people's lives, literary criticism, philosophy, and social issues.
        Tagore originally wrote in Bengali, but later reached a broad audience
        in the West after recasting his poetry in English. In contrast to the
        frenzied life in the West, his poetry was felt to convey the peace of
        the soul in harmony with nature.
